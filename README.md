Title: Exploring Multi Linear Regression for Student Performance Prediction


Introduction:


As a newcomer to machine learning, I delved into the realm of Multi Linear Regression Models to understand their application in predicting student performance. The objective was to analyze various factors such as hours studied, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and sample questions practiced to determine their impact on the performance index.

Dataset:
I utilized a dataset containing information on student performance, with the performance index as the target variable. During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, I diligently checked for outliers and missing values to ensure data integrity.

Model Evaluation:
After applying Multi Linear Regression, I observed an impressive R2 score of 99%. However, to deepen my understanding, I proceeded to implement Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression steps. Surprisingly, upon eliminating the previous scores variable, the R2 score dropped to 89%. This insightful experiment revealed that the Multi Linear Regression model performed optimally without OLS refinement.

Conclusion:
Through this exercise, I gained valuable insights into the application of Multi Linear Regression Models in predicting student performance. The high R2 score reinforced the model's efficacy, while the OLS analysis provided additional clarity on variable significance. Overall, this experience enhanced my understanding of machine learning concepts and their practical implications in educational contexts.

Future Directions:
Moving forward, I aim to explore more advanced machine learning techniques and datasets to further refine my skills and insights in this fascinating field.
